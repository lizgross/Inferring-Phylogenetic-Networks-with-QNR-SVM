# Inferring-Phylogenetic-Networks-with-QNR-SVM

This repository has the supplementary files for "Statistical Learning with Phylogenetic Network Invariants" by Travis Barton, Elizabeth Gross, Colby Long, and Joseph Rusinko.

Most of the R files with the trained support vector machines exceed GitHub's file size limit. Thus, these files, along with the training data and the test data are available on Google Drive here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U30saBqS4F2GVS64W_PTWmYcilYQWsqt?usp=sharing  The Google Drive also contains the files for the NMSC simulation study and the biological example.

The files can also be obtained by emailing the authors.
